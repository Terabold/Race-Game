## Code Improvements

### 1. **Optimized Raycasting**
The raycasting system in the `Car` class has been optimized to reduce the number of rays and improve collision detection efficiency. This reduces CPU usage and improves game performance, especially on lower-end systems.

### 2. **DRY Principle**
Repetitive code in the `Environment` and `GUI` classes has been refactored to follow the **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)** principle. For example:
- Car movement logic is now handled in a single method.
- Checkpoint and collision detection logic has been streamlined.

### 3. **Simplified Time Bonus Animation**
The `TimeBonus` class no longer uses a pulsing animation. Instead, it uses a static image for better performance and simplicity. This change reduces unnecessary calculations and improves frame rates.
